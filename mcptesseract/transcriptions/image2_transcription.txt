FACULTY OF THEOLOGY IN PARIS.

‘The motive which induces me to present to you this Treatise is so
excellent, and, when you become acquainted with its design, 1 am
convinced that you will also have so excellent a motive for taking it
‘under your protection, that I feel that I cannot do better, in order to
render it in some sort acceptable to you, than in a few words to state
‘what I have set myself to do,
