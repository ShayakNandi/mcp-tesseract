Prefatory Note To The Meditations.

‘The first edition of the Meditations was published in Latin by Michael
Soly of Paris “at the Sign of the Phoenix” in 1641 cum Privilegio et
Approbatione Doctorum. ‘The Royal “privilege” was indeed given, but
the “approbation” seems to have been of a most indefinite kind. The
reason of the book being published in France and not in Holland, where
Descartes was living in a charming country house at Endegeest near
Leiden, was apparently his fear that the Dutch ministers might in some
way lay hold of it. His friend, Pere Mersenne, took charge of its
publication in Paris and wrote to him about any difficulties that
‘occurred in the course of its progress through the press. The second
edition was however published at Amsterdam in 1642 by Louis Elzevir,
and this edition was accompanied by the now completed “Objections
and Replies.”' The edition from which the present translation is made is
the second just mentioned, and is that adopted by MM. Adam and
‘Tannery as the more correct, for reasons that they state in detail in the
preface to their edition. The work was translated into French by the
Duc de Luynes in 1642 and Descartes considered the translation so
excellent that he had it published some years later. Clerselier, to
complete matters, had the “Objections” also published in French with
the “Replies,” and this, ike the other, was subject to Descartes’ revision
